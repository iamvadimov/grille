## Cardan grille

To conduct encrypted correspondence, a special grid is used - a mask with specified elements, which are used to enter symbols of the message to be encrypted or decrypted. With the help of an 8x8 grid, you can encrypt a message with a maximum length of 64 characters. The algorithm assumes the presence of the same grids at the disposal of both the sender of the message and its recipient. A detailed description of the idea of ​​using this encryption method is given in Yakov Perelman's book "Living Mathematics", in chapter 6 "Mathematical stories and puzzles". The history of this encryption method and the general idea is described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(cryptography). 

The second part is the reverse task, that is, the restoration of the lost grid, based on the availability of encrypted and decrypted messages.
